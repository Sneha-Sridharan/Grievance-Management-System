# Grievance-Management-System

- The Grievances Management System is a common portal for the institution that facilitates students and faculties to lodge/register their complaints regarding various grievances such as lack of availability of lab equipment, sanitation issues, suggestions for lecture timetables, lack of facilities in classroom etc. 
- A Redressal Committee will handle and redress the registered grievances. This committee will be headed by a moderator (admin) who will allocate the grievances to be redresses to various members and also monitor the status or progress of redressal. 

# The system has 4 modules

1) Student module – Login, Add complaints, Delete complaints, View registered
complaints and status
2) Faculty module – Login, Add complaints, Delete complaints, View registered
complaints and status
3) Member module – Login, View assigned complaints
4) Admin module – Login, View and assign complaints, View redressed complaints

- We have used WATIR to test our application because the Grievance Management System is a web application that can run on any browser.
